        Android 11 has made it impossible for Apps to access the public storage of your phone.\n\n
        This is vital for Drill Down to store save games in a place where they both are not deleted when you uninstall the app,
        and also a place you can freely access to transfer the files to another device for instance.\n
        If you want to have this access over your files, click on "Select" and choose or create a directory on your internal storage,
        and select it for Drill Down to get access.\n\n
        This directory will then be used to store and load save files.\n
        Worthy of note: Expect some slow-down when opening the "Load Game" option in the game as
        listing all the files takes considerably longer due to this change.\n\n
        Click on "Skip" to only save files internally with no way for you to access them or create backups.\n
        You can select an external location through an option in the main menu at a later date.
